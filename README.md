To enhance my frontend skills,I decided to clone this template purely with HTML and CSS, utilizing both Angular and React. To give it a little bit of life, I created a backend for the application so that most of the things displayed on the screen from texts, icons, and images are coming from an API (dotnet core) and a database (SQL). In addition to implementing some CRUD operations, authentication and role based authorization. In the Site.mp4 video you can see the whole site and how responsive it is to different screen sizes ranging from large screens to mobile screens. And the CRUD.mp4 video is where you can see some CRUD operations and how I created an appointment . In addition to updating the name and an image of a doctor. You can also see that in the video which showcases the website, the navbar had some items and the number increased when I logged in.
